This is an update to my previous project on teeth classification, however here I decided to load a pre-trained model and finetune it.
After trying out several pre-trained models, like VGG16, MobileNetV3 & ResNet50V2, I ended up sticking with ResNet50 for its rapid convergence and for its incredible final accuracy of about 98%.
