This week's data is satellite images, captured by cameras and sensors, giving it an unusual 12 channels insteads of only 3 (RGB).
I aimed to implement an image segmentation model to label aquatic areas, were I used the famous U-Net architecture but made a few modifications to allow for more accurate predictions and better fitting to the label masks.
